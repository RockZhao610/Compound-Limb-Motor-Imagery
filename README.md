- Proposed a novel Compound-Limbs paradigm that integrates unilateral upper
limb and contralateral lower limb movements to enhance motor imagery features.
- Leveraged deep learning, specifically EEGNet, to train a motor imagery prediction
model offline. The model was deployed in an online system with real-time predic-
tions using Pylsl, incorporating transfer learning for improved performance.
- Enabled shared control between humans and lower-limb exoskeletons, contribut-
ing to more effective rehabilitation.
- Future developments will focus on integrating uncertainty estimation techniques
to further enhance predictive accuracy.
